# Traffic Mortality Reduction: Data-Driven Insights for Safer Roads
This project aims to analyze traffic accident data and identify key factors contributing to high mortality rates. The project uses data science and machine learning techniques to build predictive models that help identify accident-prone areas, risky driving behaviors, and other factors influencing fatalities. The goal is to provide actionable insights for urban planners, policymakers, and traffic safety authorities to implement effective strategies for reducing traffic-related deaths.
